R package for National Longitudinal Survey Data


The National Longitudinal Surveys provide a wealth of sociological data. However, the export facilities provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics result in a crude output format that requires a considerable time commitment from the analyst. The NLSdata package is a companion utility to the [NLS Investigator](https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login.jsp) that facilitates reading, interpreting and reshaping NLS data for a wide variety of sociological and longitudinal analyses.

NLSdata is [now on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=NLSdata)
